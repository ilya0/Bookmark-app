# Book Mark App

#### I would like to implement some sort of react or angular
### I think it would be cool if I created it as a chrome add on, then I could just add stuff to my app on a regular basis

## things I need to do
- find a node back-end so that it will show samples of the link, kind of like in facebook
- figure out where to put it so that I can always use it
    - I'm thinking maybe put it in the github pages and just not link it some where, it could be just a page
    


Front end react - need to learn this
make intial from html and css

Node back end with mongoDB for database


### to do list

-   front end - semi- complete
-   organize mvc - needs to be done
-   routes -  need delete and id routs
-   initialize db done
-   push to heroku - not done   

##Problems 
still getting cross origin request

Works
Mongod works 
db works to store stuff
js connected 



Run Sudo mongod in the backend 
Run sudo nodemon in the frontend
they work now, if not restart



Ideas to get it to work, maybe get an external mongodb?
